# *BMBO-DARN*: Batch Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Deep Auto-Regressive Networks

by [Shibo Li](https://imshibo.com), [Mike Kirby](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~kirby/) and [Shandian Zhe](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/)

This is the python implementation of the our papr [Batch Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Deep Auto-Regressive Networks]

## System Requirement
See the docker file

We highly recommend to use [_Docker_](https://www.docker.com/) to freeze the running experiments. We attach our docker build file.

## Run
run Cifar10 10
